Solving R problems and getting help
===

## Help, I don't know how to do a certain thing in R

Go through the following steps in this order

1. Google it
2. Ask your colleauges / fellow students
3. Have a look at this website / FAQs, and the scripts and books we link to
4. If neither of this helps, go to "Places to get help from" below


## Help, I have an error message that I can't resolve

First recommendation: Google it! If that doesn't help, keep on reading.

### Understanding R error messages 

If something goes wrong, R tries to tell you what the problem is. Read the error message and think about what the message could mean. Some help

### Reducing the problem to a minimal example

If that didn't help, try to isolate your problem to produce a minimal example. See 

http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example

For one thing, by doing this, you will often find the problem. And secondly, it this is not the case, you can go with your minimal example to someone else to get help. 

## Getting help

If you couldn't resolve your problem, despite taking all steps above, you need to get help. You can do this by going to your supervisor, or posting a problem on the internet.

Be adviced that in either case, the people that you are asking for help are quite busy. They can expect that you have already done everything you could to resolve the proplem, and that you prepared the things that you can't resolve in a way that makes them easy to give you help. Particularly on the internet, people can get very annoyed if you don't present your problem in the form that is most easy for them to address, i.e. as a minimal example (see above). Read, for example, http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html

Apart from your supervisor, common places on the internet that provide R help are 

* The big R mailing lists http://www.r-project.org/mail.html , see also the special interest groups
* http://stats.stackexchange.com/

R has several layers and it is sometimes difficult to understand, how to find help for a special layer. This link may help you: http://www.r-bloggers.com/21-r-navigation-tools/
